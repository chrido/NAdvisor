This is a small library which adds Aspects during runtime.

If you are looking for traditional Aspects have a look at postsharp.org

The difference compared to traditional Aspects are:
- Aspects can be instantiated, therefor can have dependencies in the constructor (fits very well with DI)
- Trades fast compilation against slower execution, everything is done during runtime
- Aspects can have a differnt lifetime than there intercepted classes. 

Some Usecases which can't be easily solved with compile time weaved aspects:
- unit testing of aspects
- because aspects are normal objects they can be instantiated, they can have dependencies. 
- Using Mocked aspects during unit tests 
- JointPoint can only be defined during runtime.


Usage:
//Instantiate a new SecurityAspect
IAspect securityAspect = new SecurityAspect(user);

//Creates a Proxy, chooses the Aspect from the List by the JointPointDefinition
Advisor advisor = new Advisor(JointPointDefinition.AttributeBasedJointPointDefinition, new List<IAspect>() {securityAspect, loggingAspect});

//Gets the Proxy which is intercepted by Aspects
ISimpleService myService = advisor.GetAdvicedProxy<ISimpleService>(simpleService);
